# LoRaWAN Decoders
## Collection of LoRaWAN payload decoders
Collection of LoRaWAN payload decoders for all sensors in [The Things Conference](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/conference/) kit.

> _Also added the Elsys ERS ECO model which I got for free at the conference_

All the files in this repo are found freely on the internet except for the MerryIoT Motion Sensor. I wrote that one myself because I could not find an example online. 

__This is just a ( personal ) collection of payload decoders__


These are being used on [TTN](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) ( The Things Network )
